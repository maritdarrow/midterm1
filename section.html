	<h1>Brie Larson Takes Home Gold</h1>
     <>Back in September, Vanity Fair film critic Richard Lawson zeroed in on the film Room as a star-making performance for Brie Larson. “Excitingly,” he wrote, ”[Room] finds Larson making good on the promise she showed in the indie drama Short Term 12 two years ago. Larson was largely known for comedy prior to that film—she was on The United States of Tara and in 21 Jump Street—so her soulful, perceptive performance came as something of a revelation. Now, in Room, Larson tackles even weightier stuff, and proves herself more than up to the task.”</p>
