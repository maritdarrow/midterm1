     <p>After a few upsets in the supporting-performer categories, the presumptive winner, Brie Larson, took home the 2016 Oscar for best actress for her work in Room. Larson began her speech by thanking the Telluride Film Festival before moving on to thank her partner in the film, Jacob Tremblay, and her partner in life, Alex Greenwald. Larson capped off her speech by saying, “Thank you to the moviegoers. Thank you for going to the theaters and seeing our films.”</p>
