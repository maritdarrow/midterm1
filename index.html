    <h1>And the Oscar Goes To...</h1>
    <h4>After a few upsets in the supporting-performer categories, the presumptive winner, Brie Larson, took home the 2016 Oscar for best actress for her work in Room. Larson began her speech by thanking the Telluride Film Festival before moving on to thank her partner in the film, Jacob Tremblay, and her partner in life, Alex Greenwald. Larson capped off her speech by saying, “Thank you to the moviegoers. Thank you for going to the theaters and seeing our films.”</h4>

    <h1>Super Tuesday Smash</h1>
    <h4>The results of the biggest voting day in the presidential contest thus far may not have been everything that front-runners Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton had hoped, but they were enough to set the course for the remainder of the nominating season.
And they were surely enough to intensify the pressure on their respective rivals.
For believers in Bernie Sanders' promise of a "political revolution," Super Tuesday may have seemed like the end of a dream.
And for Republican office-holders and party officials anxious about having Donald Trump as their presidential nominee, Super Tuesday must have been a nightmare.
Sanders went down in seven of the 11 states holding Democratic events, winning in only four where the Democratic vote was relatively small. These included his home state of Vermont, where he won with 86 percent amid turnout lower than it had been in 2008.</h4>

<h2>Kesha vs. Sony</h2>
<h4>
    There has been a huge outpouring of support for Kesha, with a #FreeKesha hashtag trending and celebrities including Lady Gaga and Kelly Clarkson speaking out in solidarity, Taylor Swift giving her $250,000, and Lena Dunham writing an open letter. But the negative responses have also come thick and fast. They range from tweets calling Kesha a “slut,” “hoe,” “bitch,” “whore” and “liar,” to talk show host Wendy Williams, who said: “If everybody complained because somebody allegedly sexually abused them… then contracts would be broken all the time.” She went on to ask: “Why weren’t they rolling camera on it?” suggesting that Kesha and her mother should have attempted to film the alleged abuse to prove it happened.</h4>
